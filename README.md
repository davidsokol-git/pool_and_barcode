# pool_and_barcode_csv

Input: pooling calculator csv output
Output: pooling calculator output with corresponding index from Laird/Shen scWGBS library prep

Take the pooling csv from Illumina's calculator and give the index associated with each scWGBS library. 

The standard indexing protocol must be followed for the code to assign the correct index to each library.  
The standard indexing protocol is found in the "scWGBS Library Preparation and Sequencing Protocol" in the Shen Lab Wet Lab SOPs.
